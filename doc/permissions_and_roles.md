## Roles and Permissions

In crowdAI there are three virtual participant roles.

- Organizer
- Participant
- Admin

The **Organizer** role granted against a participant account. Users who have the organizer role have the ability to create and modify challenges, with each challenge belonging to a single organizer under the current model. This role is currently granted by associating the organizer with the participant on the admin panel.

A **Registered Participant** is currently der
participant - challenge

When the participant is registered, they are given the participant role for that challenge.

#### Upcoming changes
A future release will move to [role-based authorisation](https://github.com/crowdAI/crowdai/issues/554) which will be required to support [multiple organizer-challenges](https://github.com/crowdAI/crowdai/issues/574) and [teams](https://github.com/crowdAI/crowdai/issues/325
