### Challenge Organizers

Organizers are groups such as universities or companies which launch competitions using crowdAI, define the competition rules and provide data and other information to competitors.

The organizers also judge the competitors and, at the end of the competition, award the winner.

#### Creation and User Association

An Organizer has one or more user accounts associated with it, these accounts are equivalent in authority and can perform the same actions.

If a user account is not associated with a Hosting Institution, a "Host" link will appear on the Navbar. The index page contains information about a hosting institutions, as well as the ability to create a new Hosting Institution.

When a user creates a new Hosting Institution, their account is automatically associated with the Hosting Institution. The details of the institution are created, and will then go into an approval workflow (to be approved by the crowdAI administrators).
