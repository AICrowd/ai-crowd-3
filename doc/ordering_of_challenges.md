## Ordering of Challenges

Challenges are ordered by several attributes:

- Featured Sequence number
- Challenge Status
- Number of participants

On the landing page, the top 5 ordered challenges are displayed.

### Featured Sequence

This is the highest sort field, and is an integer. The higher the number, the higher the sort priority (ie: highest number is first in the list).

### Challenge Status

The secondary sort field is status, ordered as:

1. Running
2. Starting soon
3. Completed
4. Draft

### Participant Count

The final sort field is participant count, which is stored on the **challenges** table.
