## Post Challenge Submissions

Submissions can sometimes be accepted after the end of the challenge. These submissions are marked as 'Post Challenge' and displayed on a separate leaderboard.

For the challenges which accept submissions via the python client, this is handled by shutting down the grader when challenges will no longer be accepted.

For the CLEF and other challenges which accept challenges via the online page, an additional checkbox is available: "Post challenge submissions?".

This allows the submission page will be visible and accept submissions after the end of the challenge. The existing grader / API code will control if the submissions are marked 'post challenge'.

Note the submissions page will always be visible to admins / organizers if the "Online submissions permitted?" checkbox is checked.
