    <span style="margin-right: 20px"></span>

      Note: To join, you'll need an AIcrowd acccount. If you already have an account with us, you'll need to link it with this invitation by claiming this email. Your unique code to do so is:
      <br>
      <b style="margin-left: 20px;"><%= @invitee.display_token %></b>
      <br>
      You can sign up <%= link_to 'here', new_participant_registration_url, target: '_blank' %>, and then link your account <%= link_to 'here', claim_emails_url(email_token: @invitee.display_token, email_confirmation: @invitee.email), target: '_blank' %>.
      <br>
      Declining does not require the creation of an account.
